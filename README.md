## Multilingual

The site is built in English, then [Rosey](https://rosey.app/) produces the French and German copies after the Astro build. English is served at the root, with the other languages under `/fr/` and `/de/`. Translations are edited in CloudCannon's Visual Editor by the [Rosey CloudCannon Connector](https://rosey.cc/) (RCC).

Two systems share the job. Short, shared strings are Rosey keys, translated once and substituted into every locale copy. Blog posts are whole documents, so Astro builds those per locale from their own content files before Rosey ever runs — see [The blog: split by directory](#the-blog-split-by-directory).

### The pipeline

`.cloudcannon/postbuild` runs four steps:

1. `rosey generate` — scans the built HTML for `data-rosey` keys into `rosey/base.json`
2. `rosey-cloudcannon-connector write-locales` — syncs those keys into `rosey/locales/{fr,de}.json` and writes the locale manifest the browser client fetches
3. `rosey build` — writes the translated copies of the site
4. `pagefind` — indexes last, so each locale gets its own search index

**CloudCannon needs `CLOUDCANNON_SYNC_PATHS=/rosey/`** so the files generated during the build are committed back. It's preset in `.cloudcannon/initial-site-settings.json` for new sites; existing sites need it added in their site settings. Without it, translations are lost on every build.

### How content gets keys

Keys are **derived from the `data-prop` attributes** the building blocks already emit for inline editing (`src/components/utils/roseyKey.ts`) — so tagging a new component usually means nothing extra. Each page-builder block namespaces its own keys with its `_uuid`, giving keys like `about:9c1e…:heading` that survive reordering.

- `data-rosey={false}` at a call site opts a value out (names, prices, post frontmatter).
- Nav and footer links use their own text as the key, under a `nav:` / `footer:` namespace, so the desktop and mobile menus share one translation each.
- Tag labels live under a shared `tags:` root, so a label is translated once for the listing, the tag page and the post breadcrumb. Tag slugs stay in English — only labels translate.
- `<title>` and the meta description are opt-in per route via a `roseySeo` prop on the layout. They aren't on the page, so they're only reachable through the **Locales** collection.

### The blog: split by directory

Whole articles are too much prose to translate through Rosey keys, so the blog uses **split-by-directory** instead: `src/content/blog_fr/` and `blog_de/` hold real content files, and `src/pages/[locale]/blog/` builds them natively. Rosey still runs over those pages and translates the shared chrome around the body — breadcrumb, "Latest News", "Share this article" — because it leaves pages that already exist at a locale URL in place.

Three of the thirteen posts are translated. The other ten are English-only and simply don't appear in `/fr/blog/` or `/de/blog/` listings; Rosey's own copies of the English pages keep them reachable rather than 404ing.

Four things hold it together:

- **Filenames match the English original.** The route derives the slug from the filename, so `/fr/blog/x/` lines up with `/blog/x/`.
- **`roseyRoot` is the English-equivalent path** (`blog/${slug}`), not the page's own URL — otherwise `/fr/blog/x/` would mint a duplicate `fr/blog/x:…` key set instead of sharing the English page's.
- **`tag`, `image`, `date` and `author` stay byte-identical.** `tag` is the URL segment _and_ the taxonomy key; only its visible label is translated, through the shared `tags:` root.
- **`paginate()` gets `props`, not just `params`.** Route params don't reach `Astro.props`, and a missing `locale` renders `/undefined/blog/2/`.

Post pages set `hideLocaleSwitcher`: the body is translated by editing the locale's own content file, so a switcher there offers nothing. The listing and tag pages keep theirs, because their headings and chips _are_ keyed.

In CloudCannon the locale collections are `disable_add` — a new post is created in the English `blog` collection and then copied across, so the filenames can't drift apart. Post dates are formatted with the locale's `dateLocale`, so French pages don't show English month names.

### What isn't translated

Post frontmatter carries no Rosey keys — it's translated natively in the locale's content file, so those elements opt out with `data-rosey={false}`. Slugs stay English in every locale (`rosey/base.urls.json` values stay `null`). Structured data (JSON-LD) and Open Graph tags are left untranslated.

### Adding a language

1. Add the code to `locales` in `src/components/utils/locales.ts`, with its `blogCollection` and `dateLocale`
2. Create `src/content/blog_<code>/` and register the collection in `src/content.config.ts`
3. Add it to `--locales` in `.cloudcannon/postbuild`
4. Add a `data_config.locales_<code>` entry and a `blog_<code>` collection in `cloudcannon.config.yml`
